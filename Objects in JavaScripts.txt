Objects in JavaScript:

1) Object is the collection of properties, and a property is an association between a key and a value.

datatype objectName = {
propertyName1 = value1,
propertyName2 = value2,
.
.
};

2) The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation. 
eg: a) objectName.propertyName
    b) objectName["propertyName"]
3)property Name is case sensitive.
4) value can be different datatype (string, number, boolean, bigint).
